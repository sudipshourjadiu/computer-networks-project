While Cisco Packet Tracer cannot natively simulate WireGuard VPN, it can be used to mimic a **VPN-like network setup** using **NAT, routing, and ACLs**. Here's an example to simulate the behavior:

---

### **Scenario: Simulating VPN Routing and NAT**
- **Goal**: Simulate client devices accessing the internet through a "VPN server" (a Cisco router configured with NAT).
- **Components**:
  - **Router 1**: Acts as the VPN server with NAT and routing enabled.
  - **Router 2**: Simulates the "internet."
  - **Two clients**: Connected to separate LAN networks.

---

### **Topology**
1. **Router 1 (VPN Server)**:
   - Interface `G0/0`: 192.168.1.1 (LAN1)
   - Interface `G0/1`: 192.168.2.1 (LAN2)
   - Interface `G0/2`: 203.0.113.1 (Public IP)

2. **Router 2 (Internet)**:
   - Interface `G0/0`: 203.0.113.2 (Internet gateway)

3. **Client 1**:
   - IP: 192.168.1.2
   - Gateway: 192.168.1.1

4. **Client 2**:
   - IP: 192.168.2.2
   - Gateway: 192.168.2.1

---

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **1. Create the Topology**
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Add the following devices:
   - Two routers (`Router 1` and `Router 2`).
   - Two PCs (`Client 1` and `Client 2`).
3. Connect the devices:
   - `Router 1 (G0/0)` ↔ `Client 1`
   - `Router 1 (G0/1)` ↔ `Client 2`
   - `Router 1 (G0/2)` ↔ `Router 2 (G0/0)`

---

#### **2. Configure Router 1 (VPN Server)**

1. **Assign IP Addresses**:
   - Enter the CLI of Router 1:
     ```plaintext
     enable
     configure terminal
     interface GigabitEthernet0/0
     ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
     no shutdown
     exit

     interface GigabitEthernet0/1
     ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
     no shutdown
     exit

     interface GigabitEthernet0/2
     ip address 203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```

2. **Enable NAT**:
   - Configure NAT to translate internal traffic (192.168.x.x) to the public IP (203.0.113.1):
     ```plaintext
     ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet0/2 overload
     access-list 1 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
     ```

   - Mark interfaces for NAT:
     ```plaintext
     interface GigabitEthernet0/0
     ip nat inside
     exit

     interface GigabitEthernet0/1
     ip nat inside
     exit

     interface GigabitEthernet0/2
     ip nat outside
     exit
     ```

3. **Enable IP Routing**:
   ```plaintext
   ip routing
   ```

4. **Set Default Route**:
   - Route all unknown traffic to Router 2 (simulated internet):
     ```plaintext
     ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
     ```

---

#### **3. Configure Router 2 (Internet)**
1. **Assign IP Address**:
   - Enter the CLI of Router 2:
     ```plaintext
     enable
     configure terminal
     interface GigabitEthernet0/0
     ip address 203.0.113.2 255.255.255.0
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```

2. **Enable IP Routing**:
   ```plaintext
   ip routing
   ```

---

#### **4. Configure the Clients**
1. **Client 1 (192.168.1.2)**:
   - Open the desktop of Client 1.
   - Set static IP:
     - IP Address: `192.168.1.2`
     - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
     - Gateway: `192.168.1.1`

2. **Client 2 (192.168.2.2)**:
   - Open the desktop of Client 2.
   - Set static IP:
     - IP Address: `192.168.2.2`
     - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
     - Gateway: `192.168.2.1`

---

#### **5. Test Connectivity**
1. **Ping Router 1 from Clients**:
   - From Client 1, ping `192.168.1.1`.
   - From Client 2, ping `192.168.2.1`.

2. **Ping Router 2 (Simulated Internet)**:
   - From both clients, ping `203.0.113.2` to confirm traffic is routed correctly.

3. **Trace Internet Routing**:
   - Use the simulation mode in Packet Tracer to trace packets from clients to the internet.

---

### **Explanation of the Configuration**
- **Router 1 acts as the VPN server**:
  - Clients route all traffic to this router.
  - NAT translates private IPs (192.168.x.x) to the public IP (203.0.113.1).
- **Router 2 acts as the simulated internet**:
  - Routes traffic back to Router 1 for NAT processing.

---

### **Limitations**
- **No Encryption**:
  - This setup does not simulate WireGuard's cryptographic features or tunneling.
- **Static Routes**:
  - The routing is static and does not adapt dynamically as in true VPN solutions.

This simulation helps understand the network flow and basic NAT operations in a VPN-like environment. If you'd like to enhance it further or need help visualizing the commands in Packet Tracer, let me know!
